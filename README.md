# Face-and-Age-Detection
A real-time gender and age detection system using OpenCV and deep learning models. It detects faces in images/videos and classifies gender while estimating age. The project uses pre-trained Caffe models for face, age, and gender detection. It can be applied in security systems, smart environments, and retail applications.
Features:
Real-time gender and age detection from images and video streams
Uses OpenCV for face detection and Caffe pre-trained models for classification
Simple setup and easy integration into IoT systems or other real-time applications
Technologies Used:
Python: Programming language
OpenCV: Open-source computer vision library for image and video processing
Caffe pre-trained models: Age and gender detection models
DNN module in OpenCV: To load pre-trained models and perform inference
Installation
Clone the Repository: To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gender-age-detection.git
cd gender-age-detection
Install Dependencies: Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure to have OpenCV installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python
Download the Pre-trained Models: The following models are required:

Face Detection model: deploy.prototxt and res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000_fp16.caffemodel
Age and Gender Detection models: deploy_age.prototxt, age_net.caffemodel, deploy_gender.prototxt, gender_net.caffemodel
Download the models from the links provided in the repository or through the following:

Face detection model
Age detection model
Gender detection model
Place these models in the models/ directory of the project.

Usage
Run the Gender and Age Detection Script: After setting up the project and downloading the necessary models, you can run the gender_age_detection.py script to start the gender and age detection.

bash
Copy code
python gender_age_detection.py
This script will start capturing video from your webcam and will display the detected gender and age on each detected face.

Sample Input:

The script will use your computer's webcam (default device) to capture frames.
The output will display the detected age and gender on the video feed.
Real-time Detection:

The face detection model will locate faces in the video feed.
The gender and age models will then predict the gender and approximate age of each face.

Dependencies:
Python 3.x
OpenCV 4.x
Numpy
Other required libraries (listed in requirements.txt)
